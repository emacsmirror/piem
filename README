piem --- Emacs tools and glue for working with public-inbox archives
====================================================================

This project is currently in the early stages of development.  In
general, anything that relates to interacting with public-inbox
(https://public-inbox.org/README) archives from Emacs is worth
considering, at least at this point.

Much of the current functionality focuses on mapping public-inbox
endpoints (email, nntp, http, rss) to associated code repositories in
order to apply patches, including integration with b4-am to extract
and process patches (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/b4/b4.git).
Upcoming development will largely focus on extending the very basic
support public-inbox's local email interface (lei).

----------------

If you're interested in applying patches but aren't working with a
public-inbox instance, it's still possible to use piem (see the
documentation).  However, in this case, you may want to consider
mailscripts (https://git.spwhitton.name/mailscripts/), a "collection
of scripts for manipulating e-mail on Debian".  Its
notmuch-extract-patch script (accessible via Emacs commands) provides
an alternative to b4 for extracting a patch series from a thread.

And if you're searching for an Emacs interface for *sending* patches,
take a look at git-email (https://sr.ht/~yoctocell/git-email/).
