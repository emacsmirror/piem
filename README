piem --- Emacs tools and glue for working with public-inbox archives
====================================================================

This project is currently in the early stages of development.  In
general, anything that relates to interacting with public-inbox
(https://public-inbox.org/README) archives from Emacs is worth
considering, at least at this point.

Much of the current functionality focuses on mapping public-inbox
endpoints (email, nntp, http, rss) to associated code repositories in
order to apply patches, including integration with b4-am to extract
and process patches (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/b4/b4.git).
Upcoming development will largely focus on extending the very basic
support public-inbox's local email interface (lei).
