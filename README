piem --- Emacs tools and glue for working with public-inbox archives
====================================================================

This project is currently in the early stages of development.  In
general, anything that relates to interacting with public-inbox
(https://public-inbox.org/README) archives from Emacs is worth
considering, at least at this point.  The near-term focus is to
support mapping public inbox endpoints (email, nntp, http, rss) to
associated code repositories, particularly in the context of applying
patch series.

Bug reports, patches, questions, and other feedback are welcome.
Please send a plain-text email to
