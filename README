piem --- Emacs tools and glue for working with public-inbox archives
====================================================================

This project is currently in the early stages of development.  In
general, anything that relates to interacting with public-inbox
(https://public-inbox.org/README) archives from Emacs is worth
considering, at least at this point.  Much of the current
functionality focuses on mapping public inbox endpoints (email, nntp,
http, rss) to associated code repositories in order to apply patches.
Documentation is available online at
