piem --- Emacs tools and glue for working with public-inbox archives
====================================================================

This project is currently in the very early stages of development.  In
general, anything that relates to interacting with public-inbox [^1]
archives from Emacs is worth considering, at least at this point.  The
near-term focus is to support mapping public inbox endpoints (email,
nntp, http, rss) to associated code repositories, particularly in the
context of applying patch series.
