piem v0.5.0 release notes
=========================

Changes since v0.4.0
--------------------

 * New library piem-debbugs.el provides Debbugs mode integration.

 * New :gnu-package property enables mapping a message to an inbox via
   the X-GNU-PR-Package header (present on <https://bugs.gnu.org>
   messages).

 * An inbox can now be linked to multiple repositories by setting
   :coderepo to a list.

 * :url values in piem-inboxes no longer require a trailing slash.

 * piem-inject-thread-into-maildir gained an INBOX argument to enable
   Lisp callers to specify an inbox.  Thanks to zimoun for the
   suggestion.

 * The piem-b4-am transient now includes --cc-trailers (added in b4
   v0.6.0).

 * The logic to insert a Message-ID header when
   piem-add-message-id-header is non-nil has been updated to account
   for a recent change in how Git spells the header.

 * piem-am now reorders attachments to be more helpful in cases where
   the sender attaches the patches out of order.  Thanks for Ihor
   Radchenko for the suggestion.

Fixes since v0.4.0
------------------

 * piem-gnus-mid-to-thread didn't consider that
   gnus-summary-display-article may dump a message in mbox format.
