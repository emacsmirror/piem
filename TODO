A (sparse and likely stale) to-do list for piem                   -*-outline-*-

* general

** "report inbox" command for debugging

** "show message ID at point" command
Should have ability to extract message ID from link (like lei-lcat)
and give priority to local sources.

** support piem-am as jumping point to existing branch?
See discussion staring at <8735i0urq7.fsf@localhost>.

* b4

** add transients for other b4 subcommands?
Only `mbox' and `am' are supported at the moment.

** piem-b4-am-from-mid: option for local-only operation
A caller that relies on piem-mid-to-thread-functions to produce a
thread may not have the URL in piem-inboxes set or b4 configured.

* lei

** history and locking for query and show buffers

** label/keyword support
See <https://public-inbox.org/meta/20210224204950.GA2076@dcvr> and
<https://public-inbox.org/meta/20210326103103.GA561@dcvr>.

** more efficient handling of remote operations

** saved searches

** show: attachment handling

** show: highlight diffs

** show: support replying

** transients for some other lei commands
