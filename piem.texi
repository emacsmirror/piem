@node Overview
@chapter Overview

piem is a collection of Emacs libraries for working with public-inbox
archives.  As much of the hard work here is already done by other Emacs
libraries---things like mail clients, news readers, Git interfaces, and
even web browsers---piem is mostly about bridging some of these parts
for convenience.

@node public-inbox
@section public-inbox
@cindex public-inbox
@cindex lore

@url{https://public-inbox.org/README.html,public-inbox} is software for
archiving public mailing lists.  Archives can be exposed over HTTP.  As
examples, @url{https://public-inbox.org/meta} serves public-inbox's own
mailing list, and @url{https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html} hosts the
archives of many Linux development mailing lists.

@cindex pull methods
These web archives are good for searching, particularly if you don't
have all of the list's messages on your local machine, or for linking to
a message.  On the other hand, the web interface isn't convenient when
you want to follow new activity on a list.  To do that, you could of
course subscribe to the mailing list, but public-inbox offers a few
``pull methods'' that you can use instead:

@itemize
@item
an atom feed for the list as a whole or for specific searches
@item
read-only NNTP
@item
read-only IMAP (new in upcoming public-inbox v1.6.0)
@end itemize

Finally, archives are exposed as one or more Git repositories,
facilitating replication (see
@url{https://public-inbox.org/reproducibility.html}).  For example, you
can clone the mailing list archives of @samp{git.vger.kernel.org} with

@example
git clone --mirror https://lore.kernel.org/git/0 git/git/0.git
@end example

@noindent
After the initial clone, new messages can be retrieved with via
@code{git fetch}.  Unsurprisingly @code{git log} is not a pleasant way
to read a mailing list; instead this method is useful for mirroring the
archive or bulk importing of the messages.  (See
@url{https://public-inbox.org/clients.html} for a list of some tools
designed to work with public-inbox archives.)


@node Getting started
@chapter Getting started

@node Registering inboxes
@section Registering inboxes
@cindex coderepo
@cindex inbox
@vindex piem-inboxes

A public-inbox archive, referred to as an @dfn{inbox}, is registered by
adding an entry to @code{piem-inboxes}.  Here's an example entry for the
Git project's mailing list:

@lisp
("git"
 :url "https://lore.kernel.org/git/"
 :address "git@@vger.kernel.org"
 :listid "git.vger.kernel.org"
 :coderepo "~/src/git/")
@end lisp

@noindent
The first element is a name for the inbox and will typically match the
name at the end of the @code{:url} value.  Specifying either
@code{:listid} or @code{:address} is important so that a message in a
buffer can be mapped to an inbox in @code{piem-inboxes}.

@code{:coderepo} points to a local Git repository that contains code
related to that archive (in the example above, a local clone of
@url{https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/}).  This information is
required to apply patches from an archive to a local code repository
(@pxref{Applying patches}).

@node Enabling integration libraries
@section Enabling integration libraries
@findex piem-elfeed-mode
@findex piem-eww-mode
@findex piem-gnus-mode
@findex piem-notmuch-mode

With inboxes defined, the next step is to enable minor modes that teach
particular Emacs modes to link a buffer with a registered inbox.  piem
currently has libraries to support

@itemize
@item EWW
@item Elfeed
@item Gnus
@item Notmuch
@end itemize

For example, if you use notmuch.el to read your mail, you can add
support for applying patches from a Notmuch message buffer by enabling
@code{piem-notmuch-mode} (@pxref{Applying patches}):

@lisp
(piem-notmuch-mode 1)
@end lisp

Help adding support for other modes, especially other mail clients, is
welcome.


@node Applying patches
@chapter Applying patches
@cindex am-ready mbox
@cindex applying patches
@cindex git-am

With @code{piem-inboxes} configured and appropriate integration
libraries enabled, a buffer that can be linked to an inbox can be mapped
to a code repository.  When reading a message in a
@code{notmuch-show-mode} buffer, for example, the list ID can be used to
identify the inbox and thus the associated local code repository.

There are two commands for applying patches:

@table @code

@item piem-am
@findex piem-am
This command tries to extract a patch from the current Notmuch or Gnus
message buffer and can handle an inline patch as well as one or more
patch attachments.

@item piem-b4-am
@findex piem-b4-am
This command relies on the b4 command-line tool to do more sophisticated
processing of the @emph{full thread} (e.g., pulling out the latest
reroll of a series) to generate an mbox that can be fed to @code{git
am}.  It is only compatible with inline patches.

@end table

@node Applying patches contained in a message
@section Applying patches contained in a message

@table @kbd
@findex piem-am
@item M-x piem-am @key{RET} @var{branch} @key{RET} @var{base}
Apply the patch or patches in the current buffer to the associated code
repository.  Before applying, checkout a new branch @var{branch}
starting at @var{base}.
@end table

@findex piem-name-branch-who-what-v
@vindex piem-default-branch-function
You'll be queried for the name of the new branch.  The default name
offered is generated by @code{piem-name-branch-who-what-v}, which uses
the @samp{From:} and @samp{Subject:} headers to construct branch names
like @samp{km/b4-short-subj__v3}.  To use a different function to
generate the completion default, configure
@code{piem-default-branch-function}.

Next you'll be queried for the base to use as the starting point for the
branch.  If the sender specified a base commit for the series, that will
be provided as the default completion candidate.  Entering an empty base
signals to use the current branch of the repository as the base.

@cindex magit
@vindex piem-use-magit
When piem loads, it detects whether Magit is loaded and sets
@code{piem-use-magit} accordingly.  If that option is non-nil, piem uses
Magit for some operations, particularly those that are user-facing.
This includes jumping to the Magit status buffer for a code repository
after apply a patch.

@findex piem-am-ready-mbox
Note that the @code{piem-am} command works only for buffers from which
@code{piem-am-ready-mbox} can generate an am-ready mbox, which depends
on the enabled integration libraries.  Currently @code{piem-notmuch} and
@code{piem-gnus} implement the necessary functionality.

@node Using b4 to apply patches
@section Using b4 to apply patches
@cindex b4
@cindex lore

@url{https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/b4/b4.git,b4} is a
command-line tool for interacting with public-inbox archives.  While
useful for public-inbox archives in general, it is written for Linux
kernel development and focuses on the public-inbox archives hosted at
@url{https://lore.kernel.org}.

It's a fast moving target at the moment, but some of its current
capabilities include

@itemize
@item
downloading the mbox for a thread based on a given message ID
@item
extracting patches from a thread's mbox that can be fed to @code{git am}
@item
submitting and verifying cryptographic attestation for patches
@item
fetching a pull request found in a message ID
@item
generating a thanks email for patches
@end itemize

@noindent
The second item is the focus for piem, though at least some degree of
support for all of the above features will likely be added.
The entry point to applying patches with b4 is the @code{piem-b4-am}
transient.  (See
@ifinfo
@ref{Top,,,transient}
@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
@url{https://magit.vc/manual/transient/}
@end ifnotinfo
for more information on using Transient.)

@findex piem-b4-am
@code{piem-b4-am} offers the following actions:

@table @kbd

@item a
@itemx M-x piem-b4-am-from-mid
@findex piem-b4-am-from-mid
Generate or download a thread's mbox based on the specified message ID,
process it into an am-ready mbox with b4, and then feed it to @code{git
am} called within an associated Git repository

@item i
@itemx M-x piem-b4-am-ready-from-mid
@findex piem-b4-am-ready-from-mid
Like @code{piem-b4-am-from-mid}, but stop before feeding the am-ready
mbox to @code{git am}, ending at the same point that b4 does when called
from the command line.

@item b
@itemx M-x piem-b4-am-ready-from-mbox
@findex piem-b4-am-ready-from-mbox
Like @code{piem-b4-am-ready-from-mid}, but process a local mbox rather
than identifying the thread based on the specified the message ID.

@end table


@node Contributing
@chapter Contributing

Patches, bug reports, and other feedback are welcome.  Please send a
plain-text email to @email{piem@@inbox.kyleam.com}.  Messages that
include this address are public and available as public-inbox archives
at @url{https://inbox.kyleam.com/piem}.  Note that this is not a mailing
list, and there are no subcribers.  Updates can be followed through one
of public-inbox's pull methods (@pxref{public-inbox}).  This means it is
particularly important to @emph{not} drop participants when replying
@footnote{@dots{} and in this author's opinion, doing so is a bad
practice anyway.}.

You can, unsurprisingly, use piem to work on piem by adding an entry
like this to @code{piem-inboxes}.

@lisp
("piem"
 :coderepo "<path/to/local/clone>"
 :address "piem@@inbox.kyleam.com"
 :url "https://inbox.kyleam.com/piem/")
@end lisp

The source repository is available at @url{https://git.kyleam.com/piem}.
Here are some guidelines for sending patches:

@itemize
@item Please send patches inline rather than as attachments.

If you're using @code{git send-email}, you may want to set
@code{sendemail.to} to @code{piem@@inbox.kyleam.com} in your local
repository.

@item Specify the base commit.

This can be done via the @code{--base=} option of @code{git
format-patch} or by configuring @code{format.useAutoBase}.

@item Keep rerolls in the same thread.

In general, prefer to keep iterations of a patch series in the same
thread, labeling rerolls with an appropriate version.
